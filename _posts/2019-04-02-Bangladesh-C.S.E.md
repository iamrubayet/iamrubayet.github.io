Tech/ C.S.E mainly practical focused subject, it starts as sub or practical domain of applied mathematics. So you have to do lots of cumulative small work with a team or a large number of people from a different domain. And you need some passionate people who can do this kind of thing's continuously plus you need lot's of them together at the same time for a bigger project because most of the problem is big. 

This is the 2 things I think is the down track of bd C.S.E. Let me explain why,

Whenever you want to do a big project or a seminar or a workshop or a simple regular class, the set of people come will come or join or interested in whom goal or passion or dream is almost the same because this way they can work more efficiently. In Bangladesh subject or educational institution is not chosen by the student interest mainly. I see lots passionate people are not getting this subject by their wish and a lot of them in this subject by biased or by chosen.

Soon after they find its a highly dedicated course and this kind of dedication is only given by self-will then they frustrated. That's the first problem that, allocating the people/student in the wrong way. 

The second problem is when you have different goal-oriented people in the same room which caused by this wrong way of choosing or C.S.E biases of the student, then you can't drive them in a unique direction. Imagine in a class where 70 students have 50 different motive like someone want govt job, someone wants to go business, etc. It's very hard to manage this mess in a concentrated direction. I am not saying everyone should have the same interest it will be very bad for idea generation but the main interest difference will be less.

This is maybe why there are very few big projects we are seeing right now, the student is unable to form an effective team that each person in that team is interested in the problem and have knowledge about this topic. 

But there is lot's of hope caused by internet open resource and now anyone can learn almost anything from anywhere, It's just a problem about finding the right interested person which also getting easy by GitHub open source, twitter, slack, etc.

Happy coding..............

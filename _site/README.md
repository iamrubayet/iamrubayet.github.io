# My personal website

My [`jekyll`](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme is modified from [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). 

I drew from many online resources in building my site, but a couple of blog posts really helped me get off the ground (I had no prior experience with `jekyll`), so I want to acknowledge those here. First, the post [building static sites with jekyll github-pages](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) by Amanda Visconti was indespensible for getting me started with a basic site locally on my machine. At the time of this writing, her post was last updated in April 2017, which is important because recent updates to `jekyll` were causing me to get stuck on some older tutorials. Visconti explains everything in far more detail than I actually needed, but glossing over stuff I already know is a small price to pay for having the basics I DON'T know explained to me very clearly and with a lot of pictures. Second, the post [blogging about R code with R Markdown, Knitr, and Jekyll](https://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html) by Nicole White helped me figure out how to use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for my posts.

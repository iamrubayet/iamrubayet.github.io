Ice hockey has been a huge part of my life since I was 10 years old. I played for [Team Korea]() at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics and at [Harvard University]() from 2006-10. Currently, I play for the [Connecticut Whale]() in the [NWHL]().

I'm a [Level 4]() USAH coach with nearly a decade of skills instruction experience. I enjoy working with every age group, gender, and skill level. Feel free to contact me about lessons or part-time/short-term coaching opportunities!

### Story time: My unlikely road to the Olympics

In North Carolina, a convergence of events in 1997/1998 led me to become a hockey player. First, the Carolina Hurricanes moved to town, creating a local burst of interest in the game. Second, the U.S. and Canadian Women's National Teams legitimized women's hockey under the Olympic spotlight in Nagano, inspiring girls to play hockey across North America. And finally, I was a 10 year old girl who knew how to skate, hated dresses and dancing, and liked physical team sports. It was inevitable that I would end up falling in love with hockey. 

And I fell hard. I loved hockey more than anything and wanted to be as good as I could be. I studied the game and was constantly on the lookout for ways to gain an edge. Throughout high school, I was driven by my desire to keep up with the boys and one day make Team USA. I worked out like a crazy person and sought as much ice time as was physically and financially possible for my family. All of this paid off in my senior year of high school, when I was recruited by a number of universities with D1 NCAA women's hockey teams, including my eventual choice of Harvard. 

But my natural athletic abilities could only stretch so far. At the height of my athletic career, I was a mediocre NCAA hockey player. I had a great experience and met some amazing people, but my contributions on the ice were nothing to write home about. I spent most of my time on the 3rd line, occasionally 2nd line and special teams, and I saw limited ice in a couple of Frozen Four appearances. After an unremarkable college performance, I didn't consider trying to play after college in 2010. It was time to grow up and pursue a real career. 

Five years later, I was back in NC and halfway through a PhD at Duke University. I was channeling nearly all of my obsessive energy towards science, with a little reserved for coaching youth hockey and playing the occasional beer-league hockey game. Hockey now had a minor but important role in my life. In the confidence-crushing environment of grad school, it can be therapeutic to do things that make you feel competent, and coaching gave me that. I never could have guessed that in 2015, hockey was going to take on a central role in my life again.

getting on team korea. 

Including me, we had a group of 6 'imports', that is, American and Canadian-Koreans who grew up in North America. Among the imports, 4 were post-university and 2 were in high school. Among the Korean-born players, 5 were in high school, 9 were in university, and 4 were post-university. We had a very good goaltender and perhaps 1.5 lines that could hold their own at a D1 college hockey level. We had 3 years to prepare for the Olympics.

going to korea. In January, 2017, I moved to Korea to live and train with the team full time. We lived at the Olympic Training Center in Seoul, where housing and meals were taken care of (the most AMAZING Korean food). We would start training around 4 pm, giving me the entire day to work on my research. On weekends, I would explore Seoul and work in cafes around the city. 

Over the course of the year, the team bonded through our ups and our downs, but mostly through downs. We lost virtually every game that season, whether it was against boys high school teams, NCAA teams in the U.S., or national teams ranked higher than us. We were trained into the ground with long days and brutal training camps. But it was all to prepare us for 5 games in February, 2018. 

In a wild turn of events 3 weeks before the Olympics, the IOC and Korean governments agreed to create a [unified Korean women's ice hockey team]() that included players from both North and South Korea. If you're curious what *that* was like, check out this [interview]() I gave about a month after the Games were over and things had calmed down. 



NWHL, future
